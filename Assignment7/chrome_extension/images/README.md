# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You'll need to create these icon files before packaging the extension for use.

## Icon Design Suggestions

The icons should represent the FAISS Web Indexer functionality:
- Consider using a magnifying glass to represent search
- Use blue or green as primary colors to suggest information retrieval
- You can create simple icons using online tools like Figma, Canva, or Iconmonstr
